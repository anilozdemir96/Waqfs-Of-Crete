# Waqfs-Of-Crete

**Description**

Waqfs of Crete is a metadata archive which describes official records of Muslim inhabitants of Crete who moved to Turkey during the 1920s due to the population exchange between Turkey and Greece. 
Crete is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, and the fifth-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea ( see Figure 5.2), after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus, and Corsica. It bounds the southern border of the Aegean Sea. Crete rests approximately 160 km south of the Greek mainland. Crete was under Ottoman rule until 1898, and there was an independent Crete State until 1908; later on, Crete became part of Greece. In the 19th century, there were large Muslim and Christian groups with occasional uprisings from both parties Kostopoulou (2016). 

Documents spanning the period from 1825 to 1928 in Ottoman Turkish and Greek provide an opportunity to examine the multi-layered social structure on the island, especially from a cultural and economic perspective.
